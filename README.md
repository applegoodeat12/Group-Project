### Jetbot

This project can be roughly divided into two parts, the first part is the remote control of jetbot, and the second part is the automatic control of jetbot. In the first part, we control the jetbot by connecting the gamepad. In the second part, we need to collect data and train the jetbot to complete the track by itself
